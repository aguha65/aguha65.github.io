<br>
<b>DISTRIBUTION</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
E. Asia - Himalayas from Afghanistan to Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan, Mayanmer, Tibet, at an altitude 2100 to 3900m in India [88].  Generally occurring in cool and moist situation with deep rich soil.
<br>
<br>
<b>CULTIVATION</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Prefers a good moist but not water-logged soil [46]. Grows well in heavy clayee soils. Plants are very shade tolerant, especially when young, but growth is slower in dense shade [115]. Intolerant of atmospheric pollution[46]. Prefers slightly acid conditions down to a pH of about 5[68]. Prefers growing on a north-facing slope[68]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm in height. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[68]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[68].
<br>
Seed sown early February in a greenhouse or outdoors in March[120]. Germination is often poor, usually taking about 6 - 8 weeks[120]. Stratification is said to produce a more even germination so it is probably best to sow the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn[85, 39]. The seed remains viable for up to 5 years if it is well stored[39].
